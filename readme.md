### Social Proof is Not in the Pudding: Impact of Github Stars on Engagement

What role does social proof play in what people choose to buy, endorse, and contribute to? We study the question on the largest developer platform, Github. We randomly buy 'stars' for some Github repositories and estimate their impact on engagement--- the number of users watching, favoriting the repository, usage--- the number of forks and downloads, and user contributions--- the number of PRs, etc. In particular, we select Github repositories of Python Packages, then filter to Github repositories with less than 10 stars that were made public in the last XX days, and then use online vendors to buy 'stars' for a random sample of these repositories and track the consequences. We find that the average impact of XX stars is XX additional stars over the next month, YY more watchers, and KK more downloads.
